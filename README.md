Better Than Default textures for Better Than Wolves

BTD (unlike balloons tower defense) aims to improve the visability and differentiation of textures with the goal of making important information immediatly avalible to the player.

For the 1.6 update of BTW my plans are to edit the volume of certian sounds (wolves and millstones primarily) in this pack as well.
Feel free to suggest texture additions or changes.

Some textures are borrowed or modified versions of the following: [Vanilla tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), [Dawns Vanilla Plus](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=9957), and [BTW Texture Tweaks](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=10266)
