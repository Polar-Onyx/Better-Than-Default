**Better Than Default textures for Better Than Wolves CE2.1.4** (also semi compatible with vanilla mc 1.5.2)

For the translucent gui version the [Translucency-Addon](https://github.com/BTW-Community/Translucency-Addon/releases) is required.

BTD (unlike balloons tower defense) aims to improve the visibility and differentiation of textures with the goal of making important information immediately available to the player.

3.0 pack update comming soon:tm:
Feel free to suggest texture additions or changes.

Some textures are borrowed or modified versions of the following: [Vanilla tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), [Dawns Vanilla Plus](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=9957), and [BTW Texture Tweaks](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=10266)
