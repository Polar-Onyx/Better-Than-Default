**Better Than Default textures for Better Than Wolves CE2.1.4** (also semi compatible with vanilla mc 1.5.2)

BTD (unlike balloons tower defense) aims to improve the visibility and differentiation of textures with the goal of making important information immediately available to the player.

For the 1.6 update of BTW my plans are to edit the volume of certain sounds (wolves and millstones primarily) in this pack as well.
Feel free to suggest texture additions or changes.

Some textures are borrowed or modified versions of the following: [Vanilla tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/), [Dawns Vanilla Plus](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=9957), and [BTW Texture Tweaks](https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=10266)

## Installation
Simply [Download](https://github.com/Polar-Onyx/Better-Than-Default/releases/) the latest Better-Than-Default.zip and place it in ``.minecraft\texturepacks`` or drag and drop via multimc/prism ``Edit instance > Texture packs`` you don't need to unzip the texture pack.
